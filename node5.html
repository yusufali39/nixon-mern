    <h1>Dear me</h1>
    <p>
        Fall in love with someone who wants you, who waits for you. 
        Who understands you even in the madness; someone who helps 
        you, and guides you, someone who is your support, your hope.
        Fall in love with someone who talks with you after a fight.
        Fall in love with someone who misses you and wants to be with 
        you. Do not fall in love only with a body or with a face; 
        or with the idea of being in love.

        Someone who speaks highly of you. Someone you can laugh with. 
        The kind of laughs that make your belly ache, and your 
        nose snort. The embarrassing, earnest, healing kind of 
        laughs. Wit is important. Life is too short not to love 
        someone who lets you be a fool with them. Make sure they 
        are somebody who lets you cry, too. Despair will come. 
        Find someone that you want to be there with you through 
        those times. Most importantly, marry the one that makes 
        passion, love, and madness combine and course through you. 
        A love that will never dilute - even when the waters get 
        deep, and dark.

        Stop giving a fuck about what others think. It literally 
        does not matter. People are not you. No one knows what you want, 
        except for you. Take people's opinions as guidelines, not as 
        instructions on how to live your life. If it makes sense to you, 
        do it. And if it doesn't, don't do it. If it makes you happy, 
        it's worth doing it. The things that make you happy don't always 
        make others happy. Which is why sometimes people don't agree with 
        your choices. At the end of it all, you've got one life. Don't 
        spend your life trying to tiptoe around the things that make you 
        happy because you're afraid of what others might think. Fuck what 
        they think. As long as you can live with the consequences, this 
        life is yours and you should do what you want with it.</p>
